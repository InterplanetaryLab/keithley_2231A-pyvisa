# Keithley 2231A-30-3 Pyvisa library
Basically relatively simple pyvisa library for interfacing with the keithley psu. Not every scpi command is implemented but the rest will be added later (or feel free to submit a pr with implemented commands


# Installation
 - Basically just install pyvisa and configure it as needed
 - I assume psu is hooked up via an usb ttl adapter but this can be adapted if needed
